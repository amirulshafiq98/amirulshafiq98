# ðŸ“Š Amirul Shafiq - Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi, I'm Amirul â€” a data enthusiast with a Bachelor's in Food Technology from the Singapore Institute of Technology (convocation October 2025). Over the past four years, I've immersed myself in analysing diverse datasets to assess the viability of novel food products developed during my undergraduate studies. This experience honed my skills in data analysis and storytelling to effectively engage stakeholders.

My pivotal moment came during an internship at Chiang Mai University, Thailand, where I assisted local beekeepers in determining optimal honey storage conditions. Despite collecting extensive data over 12 weeks, initial results were inconclusive. This challenge sparked my deep interest in data analysis, driving me to uncover actionable insights before returning to Singapore.

Beyond data, I enjoy exploring history, playing football (soccer), and continuously learning new skills â€” be it technical projects or enhancing communication abilities. I thrive in collaborative environments, believing that the best ideas emerge through teamwork.
